      <h2><em>A Little More About Jessy Carlson</em></h2>
      <h2> I come from a long line of dairy farmers. My early years were spent milking cows and growing raspberries on my grandparents' farm in central Wisconsin. So a love for the land runs in my blood! That love led me to study plant ecology, wetland plant restoration, and forest management in college. I went on to research sustainable economic development, receiving my Master's Degree in northern environments and cultures. I bring this broad foundation of big-picture sustainability to my work, as well as a love for all things green, feathery, furry, or muddy. Pair all that with my extensive greenhouse propagation and landscape installation experience, and I’m all set to turn your yard into a native Northern woodland or a beautiful hyper-local food production system!
