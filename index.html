      <h2> I come from a long line of dairy farmers, and spent my early years milking cows and growing raspberries on my grandparents' farm in central Wisconsin. Farming, and a love for the land, runs in my blood. I studied plant ecology, wetland plant restoration, and forest management in college, and went on to study sustainability in grad school. I bring a broad background of big-picture sustainabiltiy to my work, together with a love for all things green feathery, furry, and muddy.
      Coupled with extensive greenhouse propagation and landscape installation experience, I am ready and able to turn your backyard into a Northern native woodland, or a beautiful, hyper local food production system!
