      <h2> Jessy come from a long line of dairy farmers, and spent my early years milking cows and growing raspberries on my grandparents' farm in central Wisconsin. Farming, and a love for the land, runs in my blood. Jessy studied plant ecology, wetland plant restoration, and forest management in college, and went on to study sustainability in grad school. Jessy bring a broad background of big-picture sustainabiltiy to my work, together with a love for all things green feathery, furry, and muddy.
      Coupled with extensive greenhouse propagation and landscape installation experience, Jessy is ready and able to turn your backyard into a Northern native woodland, or a beautiful, hyper local food production system!
